# SuperCode Final project

# Goals:
To making or suggest couple of functionalities to supercode project

# Libraries and tools
React, ReactDOM, creat-react-app, npm. 
State management is done with 'useState' hook and other time with class based components.

# Techniques used and caveats:
This should be a front end for a backend project but there no time to connected properly so we decided to seperate the front end.
We couldn't make our component more reusable because lake of time and varied skill of the team.

# Install and run

>npm install

>npm start
