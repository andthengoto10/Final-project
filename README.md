# SuperCode Final project

# Goals:
To making or suggest couple of functionalities to supercode project

# Libraries and tools
React, ReactDOM, react-router, creat-react-app, npm, moment.
State management is done either with 'useState' hook or with class based components.

# Techniques used and caveats:
This should be a front end for a backend project but there no time to connected properly so we decided to seperate the front end.
We couldn't make our component more reusable because lake of time and varied skill of the team.

# Todo:
Make a reusable member component and connect it with report.
and other many things..
